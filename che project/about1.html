                <p class="lead">In 2009, the Expert Meeting organized by FAO predicted an increase of around 34% of the
                    world population by 2050, associated with an increase of 70% in food production demand (Food and
                    Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2009). However, only in 10 years, we experienced an
                    increase of around 12.5% ​​in the world population. To overcome the challenge of producing food to
                    feed all nations, in 2015, the United Nations signed the 2030 Agenda, which contemplates 17 goals to
                    achieve the world’s sustainable development (The World Bank, 2020, United Nations, 2020). We can
                    highlight at least five goals from the 2030 Agenda when we think about alternative food sources. It
                    means that zero hunger, good health and well-being, responsible consumption and production, climate
                    action, and life on land are goals related to the way we produce, access, and consume the food in
                    the world (United Nations, 2020).

                    However, some questions remain unanswered. How, how much, and which resources will be necessary to accomplish these goals and guarantee food security to the population? Will we be sustainable in food production and food intake if we maintain our current production methods and eating habits?

We should also start to think about how much food we waste in the whole food supply chain, including at home. In fact, there is evidence that most food waste happens in the post-consumer stage, for example, in households (Parfitt et al., 2010, Unger and Razza, 2018). Since 2014, the number of hungry people in the world has increased exponentially (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, International Fund for Agricultural Development, United Nations Children’s Fund, World Food Programme, & World Health Organization, 2020), and almost 1.3 billion tons of food that could be destined for human consumption are lost or wasted per year (HLPE, 2014). Therefore, if we do not change our way of producing and consuming foods, we will probably not reach the zero-hunger target by 2030.

The impact of hunger can be seen in children's stunting, low cognitive development, and high susceptibility to develop diseases, characteristics that decrease the productivity in adult life, impacting the nations’ economy and development (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations et al., 2020). Malnutrition is still a challenge to be overcome in many nations, and the goal of zero hunger from the 2030 Agenda is unlikely to be reached. With the Covid-19 pandemic, issues such as food security and the nutritional quality of the diet of vulnerable populations in developing countries are likely to be aggravated due to socioeconomic impacts.

On the other hand, statistical data have shown the prevalence of obesity pandemic worldwide. In many cases, overeating is associated with low quality of food intake, contributing to an increase in body weight, and hiding severe nutritional deficiencies (Otto et al., 2018). A poor diet due to the low nutritional quality of food can lead to malnutrition and, in some cases, contribute to some individuals’ overweight (Kelen, Nouhuys, Kehl, Brack, & Silva, 2015). Child overweight is not decreasing, and adult obesity is increasing in all world regions (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations et al., 2020). The rates of premature or preventable deaths and incapability are associated with the increase in non-communicable diseases, which is positively correlated to the obesity pandemic (Di Angelantonio et al., 2016).

In this way, food insecurity is not restricted only to undernourishment, but also to the overweight and obesity pandemic the world faces. The adoption of a more balanced, nutritious and sustainable diet is a concern of the World Health Organization (WHO) and other organizations linked to food security and health (Burlingame and Dernini, 2012, Food and Agriculture., 2020). The search for accessible food sources rich in nutrients and non-nutrients can be an alternative to circumvent food insecurity and ensure access to healthy food for the general population. In this way, this review will address the contribution of non-conventional food plants to human food, as well as the use of grains, flowers, honey and pollen, and edible insects.
