                <p class="lead">Consumers have shown great interest and concern about their health and quality of life
                    through healthy eating. In 2019, the EAT-Lancet initiative was launched by The EAT-Lancet Commission
                    on Food, Planet, Health, focusing on the 17 goals of the 2030 Agenda, to discuss alternatives to
                    improve human diet and minimize the impacts of the global food system on the environment. One of the
                    EAT-Lancet initiative proposals for the adoption of a healthy diet is the increase in plant-based
                    food consumption and the decrease in red meat and sugar intake (EAT, 2019).

                    Non-conventional food plants are usually known in Brazil by the acronym PANCs (Plantas Alimentícias
                    Não-Convencionais), a name given by the botanical researchers Kinupp & de Barros (2007), references
                    in Brazil for the study of this kind of plants. They are wild edible plants (WEP), herein referred
                    to as PANCs, that comprise thousands of rustic and native plant species of wild nature, rich in
                    nutrients, being a good alternative for improving the quality of nutrition of the population, mainly
                    in developing countries. They can also be cultivated in flowerbeds, vases, and urban gardens, which
                    is a good alternative for those living in urban areas.

                        In addition to the great potential to fight food insecurity in Brazil, WEP are important in the
                        socioeconomic sector for generating jobs and income in the entire vegetable production chain.
                        Adopting systems to produce nutritious and sustainable food to guarantee the population’s food
                        security is a global challenge. However, it is important to highlight that some non-conventional
                        or wild foods, such as WEP, are considered regular by certain populations in determining
                        geographic areas. In this sense, changes in people's food habits, especially in the urban area,
                        possibly negatively impacted the consumption and recognition of WEP. Nevertheless, their
                        nutritional quality and easy production should be valued and incentivized as an alternative to
                        offer more sustainable and healthy foods to feed the population and a pathway to achieve some of
                        the 2030 Agenda global goals.

                        There are more than 45 thousand Brazilian native species, and about 10% of them are food plants,
                        many of which have not yet been studied (Brasil, 2010). Despite this vast biodiversity, the main
                        foods used for human consumption come from a conventional and limited agri-food system,
                        dominated by monocultures. In this scenario, the WEP represent a great economic potential for
                        promoting a more nutritious, sustainable diet and value family farming (Kinupp, 2014). Many of
                        these WEP can be cultivated in water-restricting conditions, which means that their cultivation
                        could contribute to achieving the target of sustainable management and use of natural resources,
                        reducing the impacts of food production on climate changes (United Nations, 2021). It is
                        important to highlight that agriculture is the sector that most consumes fresh water in Brazil
                        (Castanho Filho et al., 2015, FAO, 2018).

                        WEP are sources of nutrients such as carbohydrates, proteins, amino acids, lipids, as well as
                        bioactive compounds and phytochemicals, and several of them have therapeutic effects and are
                        used to treat diseases such as azedinha (Rumex acetosa), beldroega (Portulaca oleracea),
                        peixinho (Stachys byzantina), serralha (Sonchus oleraceus), and vinagreira (Hibiscus sabdariffa)
                        (Botrel, Freitas, Fonseca, Melo, & Madeira, 2020). In addition to the nutraceutical aspect, they
                        are easy to grow and adapt to the environment, not requiring pesticides or fertilizers for their
                        cultivation (Kinupp, 2014), resulting in a more sustainable and ecological farming.

                        Diet quality is a critical link between food security and nutrition, where WEP can reduce the
                        state of malnutrition in Brazil and other countries. Thus, humanity’s greatest challenge is to
                        transform conventional food production systems to obtain healthy, affordable, and sustainable
                        diets. WEP are powerful tools in the fight against food insecurity since their planting is of
                        short cycles, cultures are rich in nutrients, rustic, in several regions, they represent the
                        country’s cultural identity and favor the empowerment of family farmers (Jacob, Araújo de
                        Medeiros, Albuquerque, & Bussmann, 2020).

                        The demand for WEP has grown significantly in the last few years; however, their current
                        production does not have an established chain, implying limited and seasonal distribution at
                        farmers’ fairs and municipal markets. In this way, Lemos et al. (2018) have carried out studies
                        to increase production and strengthen the Brazilian chain of native species, encouraging their
                        cultivation by producers. The Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (EMBRAPA) has a
                        germplasm bank of various species that maintains the WEP and aims at the greater productivity,
                        sustainability, and profitability of their production (Vidal, Hello, & Madeira, 2018). The
                        transfer of this technology to producers, mostly small ones, also represents a cultural rescue
                        and food security action (Kinupp, 2014).

                        WEP are important ingredients in the cuisine of different Brazilian regions, being part of the
                        gastronomic identity of certain locations, such as the state of Minas Gerais, where they were
                        widely consumed before the rural exodus. In some cities and regions, they are still
                        traditionally consumed in salads or sautéed, which are easy to prepare most of the time.
                        However, the type of culinary preparation depends on the edible part of the WEP, such as leaves,
                        fruits, flowers, seeds, pods, roots, branches, sprouts, which can be consumed fresh or used to
                        make juices, stews, salads, sweets, jellies, ice creams, sautéed, and cakes, among others. There
                        are many ways to incorporate WEP in the diet; however, no public policies are established to
                        popularize WEP consumption and no nutritional education activities to encourage their
                        cultivation and use by the population.

                        Several WEP have the technological potential of use in food, chemical, and pharmaceutical
                        industries. In this way, WEP starchy tropical tuberous vegetables represent a significant
                        potential to be investigated, as they are rich sources of starch with great unexplored genomic
                        diversity. For example, cará (Dioscorea sp), inhame (Colocasia esculenta), and mangarito
                        (Xanthosoma mafaffa) are rich in polysaccharides, whose rheological characterization still needs
                        further studies (Andrade, Barbosa, & Pereira, 2017). These starches can be used as raw materials
                        for edible and intelligent packaging so that new types of biodegradable food coatings are
                        developed (Galus et al., 2020, Martins da Costa et al., 2020).

                        Xanthosoma mafaffa is a WEP of great nutritional value and endangered of extinction. Some clones
                        rich in carotenoids have yellow color (Madeira, Botrel, Amaro, & Melo, 2015), with a pleasant
                        and unique flavor, being considered a culinary delicacy. Yam (Dioscorea sp) has an expressive
                        consumption worldwide, surpassing other crops, such as sweet potatoes and cassava. This WEP is
                        rich in calcium and iron, and its starch has properties similar to corn (Andrade et al., 2017).
                        Moreover, purple yam has anthocyanins in its composition, which are natural pigments with
                        antioxidant capacity, giving an interesting color to these tubers purees or products (Gras et
                        al., 2017, Teixeira et al., 2013). Using these rhizomes and tubers, technological possibilities
                        are in the fermentation processes as a carbon source for biocomposites such as enzymes,
                        polymers, organic acids, vitamins, dyes, and alcohol (Farias et al., 2020).

                        Leafy vegetables are the main sources of phytochemicals, fibers, minerals, and bioactive
                        compounds, such as carotenoids, chlorophylls, anthocyanins, and phenolic compounds (Caxito et
                        al., 2015, de Almeida Jackix et al., 2013). The mineral content of some species of leafy
                        vegetables varied from 106.96 to 891.21 mg/100 g of potassium, 10.14 to 252.63 mg/100 g of
                        magnesium, 69.36 to 269.38 mg/100 g of calcium, and 0.46 to 6.83 mg/100 g of iron (Botrel et
                        al., 2020). Also, peixinho (Stachys byzantina) had a high content of dietary fiber (13.21 mg/100
                        g) compared to the other thirteen species evaluated (Botrel et al., 2020).

                        Infusion of leaves, popularly consumed in the form of tea, have shown positive effects in the
                        fight against respiratory diseases such as asthma, bronchitis, colds, pneumonia, and
                        tuberculosis (Stachys byzantina); digestive and stimulant (Sonchus oleraceus),
                        anti-inflammatory, diuretic, and vermifuge action (Portulaca oleracea) (Bahadori et al., 2020,
                        Chen et al., 2019, Iranshahy et al., 2017).

                        Ora-pro-nobis (Pereskia aculeata) is a leafy WEP that has been in evidence due to its
                        nutritional properties, mainly because of the high protein content compared to other leafy
                        vegetables (Souza et al., 2020, Takeiti et al., 2009). It is also rich in phenolic compounds and
                        has antimicrobial effect (Garcia et al., 2019), while diuretic and hypotensive effects were
                        observed in in vivo tests (Kazama et al., 2012).

                        Pereskia aculeata leaves have a mucilage (polysaccharide) formed by arabinogalactan and
                        proteins, allowing their application as an emulsifier and stabilizer in the food industry (Lima
                        Junior et al., 2013, Lise et al., 2021, Silva et al., 2019). Biodegradable and edible films
                        using Pereskia aculeata mucilage are promising alternatives for the development of biodegradable
                        or edible packaging (Oliveira et al., 2019). Polysaccharides formed by carbohydrates and
                        proteins are also key elements in new product design, such as encapsulating and thickening
                        agents (Martin, de Freitas, Sassaki, Evangelista, & Sierakowski, 2017). Particulate composites
                        based on pectin and chitosan containing Pereskia aculeata were viable to release iron in food
                        supplementation or fortification to treat anemia (Maciel, Yoshida, Boesch, Goycoolea, &
                        Carvalho, 2020).

                        Taioba (Xanthosoma sagittifolium taioba) is another subsistence agriculture plant with leaves
                        rich in nutrients that showed anti-cancer properties (de Almeida Jackix, Monteiro, Raposo, &
                        Amaya-Farfán, 2013). Similar to ora-pro-nobis, it has a high concentration of oxalate,
                        alkaloids, and latex, requiring thermal processing before consumption (Silveira, Picinin,
                        Cirillo, Freire, & Barcelos, 2020).

                        Spilantol is a bioactive compound found in jambu (Acmella oleracea) leaves that causes numbness
                        in the tongue and lips and has been showing potential for pharmaceutical use as an
                        anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antifungal, analgesic, and antimalarial substance (Pastre &
                        Alonso, 2016). Table 1 shows some examples of WEP and the respective edible part usually used
                        for food.
