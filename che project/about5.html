                <p class="lead">Everyone recognizes apiculture; however, we have another kind of bee that produces
                    honey, pollen, propolis, and cerumen with high nutritional and economic potentials. Stingless bees
                    (Hymenoptera, Apidae, Meliponini) have a non-functional sting (vestigial), and they cannot sting.
                    This absence of sting makes it easy to extract their products, compared with the extraction of the
                    bee Apis mellifera (European honeybees) products, which requires proper safety equipment (Abd Jalil
                    et al., 2017, Nordin et al., 2018).

                    There are more than 500 species of native stingless bees distributed in tropical and subtropical
                    regions around the world, such as in Central America, South America, Africa, Southeast Asia, and
                    Australia (Hrncir et al., 2016, Michener, 2013, Smith et al., 2017). The composition and bioactive
                    profile of stingless bee products have been considered superior to the A. mellifera products,
                    characteristics attributed to the bee species, and the rich vegetation in the regions where these
                    bees are found (Al-Hatamleh et al., 2020).

                <p class="lead">The rational breeding of stingless bees is called Meliponiculture. This activity
                    generates benefits in the environmental, social, cultural, and economic domains, promoting
                    sustainability. Meliponiculture has been practiced for centuries by pre-colonial populations and has
                    been gaining adepts in recent years (Barbiéri & Francoy, 2020). Consequently, the interest in
                    stingless bee products increased significantly in the last five years, and the main direct products
                    from Meliponiculture are the pot-honey and pot-pollen. These terms are used to differ the products
                    stored inside the nests of A. mellifera (honey and bee-bread stored into combs made of wax) from the
                    products of stingless bees (honey and pollen stored inside pots made of cerumen) (Vit et al., 2013,
                    Vit et al., 2018).

                    The transformation of nectar into honey by stingless bees takes place inside cerumen pots. The
                    nectar is partially dehydrated, fermented by symbiotic microorganisms (yeast and bacteria), and the
                    enzymes secreted by the worker bees hydrolyze the sucrose into fructose and glucose. The
                    phytochemicals of cerumen are infiltered into the honey while the nectar is converted into honey
                    (Abd Jalil et al., 2017).

                    Stingless bees collect pollen from flowers, add salivary substances and store this mix into cerumen
                    pots inside the beehive to produce pot-pollen. The specialized microbiota has also been called
                    responsible for pot-pollen production, which is obtained after fermentation of the stored pollen.
                    During microbial fermentation, enzymes may be secreted, and amino acids become more available due to
                    proteolysis. Pot-pollen microbiota can also produce vitamins and bioactive compounds (Menezes,
                    Paludo, & Pupo, 2018). Due to the variety of symbiotic microorganisms in pot-honey and pot-pollen,
                    these products are considered sources of probiotics (Mohammad et al., 2021, Syed Yaacob et al.,
                    2018, Zulkhairi Amin et al., 2019), enzymes, and antimicrobial compounds for biotechnological
                    applications (Ngalimat, Raja Abd. Rahman, Yusof, Syahir, & Sabri, 2019).

                    In general, pot-honey has a higher moisture content and acidity and lower sugar content than A.
                    mellifera honey (Nordin, Omar et al., 2018). Besides fructose, glucose, and other sugars, pot-honey
                    may contain the bioactive disaccharide trehalulose. This disaccharide was recently identified as a
                    major component (13–44%) of honey from five different stingless bee species from Neotropical and
                    Indo-Australian regions. Trehalulose may contribute to health benefits related to antidiabetic
                    activity and low glycemic index (Fletcher et al., 2020). Regarding pot-pollen composition, this
                    product generally has a high content of proteins, fibers (Rebelo et al., 2021, Rebelo et al., 2016),
                    polyunsaturated fatty acids (Belina-Aldemita, Opper, Schreiner, & D'Amico, 2019), essential amino
                    acids (Chuttong, Phongphisutthinant, Sringarm, Burgett, & Barth, 2018), phytosterols, and
                    polyphenols (Belina-Aldemita et al., 2019).

                    Native populations worldwide have long used stingless bee products to prevent or treat a variety of
                    diseases (Lopes et al., 2020, Zulkhairi Amin et al., 2018). Despite an increase in the number of
                    publications related to pot-honey’s potential therapeutic effects (Table 5) and pot-pollen (Table
                    6), these products have been evaluated only in silico, in vitro, and in vivo by using animal models.
                    Therefore, of the literature lacks studies in humans confirming the positive effects related to
                    health. Most of the therapeutic effects found in pot-honey and pot-pollen are attributed to their
                    content of polyphenols. The composition and therapeutic properties of both products are influenced
                    by the climatic conditions, bee species, geographic, and botanic origin (Ávila et al., 2019,
                    Badrulhisham et al., 2020, Belina-Aldemita et al., 2019, Duarte et al., 2018, Vit et al., 2016).

                <p class="lead">Information about the quantity of pot-honey and pot-pollen the stingless bees can
                    produce is scarce and varies according to stingless bee species and geographical origin. In the
                    state of Bahia (Brazil), the yield of pot-pollen from Scaptotrigona spp. is 5.0–6.0 kg/colony/year;
                    Melipona fasciculata and Melipona scutellaris produce 4.0–5.0 kg/colony/year; Melipona mandacaia and
                    Tetragonisca angustula produce 3.0–4.0 kg/colony/year; while Trigona spinipes produces lower
                    quantities, 0.70–0.90 kg/colony/year (de Oliveira Alves & Carvalho, 2018). Australian stingless bees
                    can produce approximately 1 kg/colony/year of pot-honey (Halcroft, Spooner-Hart, & Dollin, 2013),
                    while in Costa Rica, the mean quantity of pot-honey is 836 mL/hive/year (Aguilar, Herrera, & Zamora,
                    2013).

                    The fermented products from the stingless bees, in general, are sour compared with A. mellifera
                    products (Nordin et al., 2018, Vit et al., 2016), but the flavor may vary according to bee species
                    and floral origins, which gives stingless bee products unique and valuable sensory characteristics.
                    Nowadays, pot-honey and pot-pollen have been used by renowned chefs and incorporated into haute
                    cuisine (Barbiéri & Francoy, 2020). There is no doubt that meliponiculture maintenance favors the
                    preservation of native flora and promotes economic development and generation of income and provides
                    beneficial health effects to the consumers.
