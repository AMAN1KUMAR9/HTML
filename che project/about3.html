                <p class="lead">Several plant foods have been extensively studied and introduced into the human diet as
                    unconventional protein sources due to their excellent nutritional composition. Among these foods,
                    sorghum and the so called pseudocereals amaranth, quinoa, and chia have amino acid compositions with
                    high bioavailability and content of essential amino acids (Belton and Taylor, 2004, Castro‐Alba et
                    al., 2019Castro‐Alba et al., 2019Castro‐Alba et al., 2019, López et al., 2018, Martínez-Villaluenga
                    et al., 2020), which favors their use as animal protein substitutes. These pseudocereals and grain
                    stand out among others because of their high amount of sulfur amino acids and minerals, such as
                    calcium, iron, and zinc, in addition to vitamins and phytochemicals (Castro‐Alba et al.,
                    2019Castro‐Alba et al., 2019Castro‐Alba et al., 2019, Girard and Awika, 2018). Additionally, they
                    can contribute to improving the consumption of fibers, polyphenols, minerals, and vitamins.

                    Amaranth, chia, and quinoa have grown in tropical and subtropical regions and have been included in
                    the Incas’ diet for centuries (López et al., 2018).

                    The Maya were probably the first people to use amaranth as a productive crop, and the Incas and the
                    Aztecs later adopted it (Escudero, de Arellano, Luco, Giménez, & Mucciarelli, 2004, Martinez-Lopez
                    et al., 2020). Currently, these foods are grown not only in Mexico and Central America, but also in
                    Bolivia, Argentina, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Peru (Morales et al., 2020, Orona-Tamayo et al., 2019,
                    Tang and Tsao, 2017). Amaranth and quinoa have been used recently due to their potential health
                    benefits, such as lowering cholesterol, anticancer, antioxidant, and antihypertensive properties
                    (Cazarin et al., 2012, Morales et al., 2020). In 2013, the United Nations Food and Agriculture
                    Organization encouraged the planting and research of amaranth, quinoa, and their products to be
                    adapted in most tropical regions and temperate climates in the world (Tang & Tsao, 2017).

                    These products have gained prominence in the consumer market because they are gluten-free, which
                    makes them an alternative source in the diet of celiac patients, contributing to an adequate
                    nutrient intake (Filho et al., 2017, López et al., 2019, López et al., 2018, Niro et al., 2019, Tang
                    and Tsao, 2017). The expected annual growth rate for the “gluten-free” market is 9.1% from 2019 to
                    2025 (Martínez-Villaluenga et al., 2020). These pseudocereals can be consumed mainly as flour or
                    grains/seeds, used in cereal-based preparations and products, such as soups, yogurts, salads, cakes,
                    and bread (Niro et al., 2019, Pereira et al., 2019), increasing the variety of dishes and
                    preparations for celiac people.

                    Amaranth is a dicotyledonous plant from the Amaranthaceae family that comprises more than 60 species
                    of the genus Amaranthus worldwide. Among the Amaranthus species used for human consumption are
                    Amaranthus caudatus, Amaranthus cruentus, and Amaranthus hypochondriacus (Orona-Tamayo et al.,
                    2019). They are composed of 13.2 to 18.4% of proteins relatively rich in lysine (limiting amino acid
                    in cereals), tryptophan, and sulfur amino acids (Orona-Tamayo et al., 2019, Quiroga et al., 2017,
                    Soares et al., 2015, Tang and Tsao, 2017); 2.2 to 6.7% of fibers; up to 13% of lipids rich in
                    linoleic acid; and 57 to 65.3% of carbohydrates mainly constituted by starch (Orona-Tamayo et al.,
                    2019, Tang and Tsao, 2017). Minerals represent approximately 1.5% of the amaranth composition,
                    especially calcium, iron, manganese, magnesium, potassium, and sodium (Orona-Tamayo et al., 2019,
                    Tang and Tsao, 2017). In fact, compared to other grains, amaranth has the highest amount of
                    gluten-free protein, calcium, dietary fibers, and essential amino acids necessary for healthy living
                    (Jimoh, Afolayan, & Lewu, 2018). The leaves of Amaranthus deflexus L. can also be eaten as stews or
                    steamed (Jimoh et al., 2018).

                    Quinoa belongs to the Chenopodiaceae family, genus Chenopodium quinoa wild, and it is a tetrapod
                    species that has been extensively explored due to its easy adaptation and growth in different
                    environmental conditions (Dakhili et al., 2019, Pereira et al., 2019). Its excellent nutritional
                    composition is based on essential amino acids, such as lysine, tryptophan, and cysteine, with an
                    average proximate composition of 14.1% proteins, 6.2% lipids, 64.2% carbohydrates, 7% fibers, and
                    1.3% minerals (Tang & Tsao, 2017), such as calcium, magnesium, iron, manganese, copper, and
                    potassium (Dakhili et al., 2019, Filho et al., 2017).

                    In addition to the composition in macronutrients and micronutrients, amaranth and quinoa have
                    bioactive compounds such as phenolic acids, flavonoids, anthocyanins, tannins, and phytosterols
                    (Tang & Tsao, 2017). These bioactive compounds possess a potent antioxidant capacity and can reduce
                    the risk of developing degenerative diseases associated with oxidative stress (Filho et al., 2017).
                    Flavonoids, such as quercetin and kaempferol, stand out for their antioxidant capacity in quinoa,
                    while in amaranth, this activity is mainly exerted by caffeic, p-hydroxybenzoic, and ferulic acids
                    (Filho et al., 2017).

                    The bioactive peptides with antihypertensive, antimicrobial, hypocholesterolemic, antioxidant,
                    hypoglycemic, and immunomodulatory properties are also noteworthy (Orona-Tamayo et al., 2019,
                    Quiroga et al., 2017, Soares et al., 2015). In quinoa, low molecular weight peptides (5 to 9 amino
                    acid residues) released by alcalase action have the antioxidant capacity and angiotensin-converting
                    enzyme (ACE) inhibitor activity (Orona-Tamayo et al., 2019). Recent studies observed a potent in
                    vitro hypoglycemic effect through the inhibition of key enzymes such as dipeptidyl peptidase IV
                    (DPP-IV), α-amylase, and α-glucosidase after gastroduodenal protein digestion (López et al., 2019,
                    Morales et al., 2020). This activity was also reported by the inhibition of α-amylase in amaranth
                    grains (Martínez-Villaluenga et al., 2020).

                    The antioxidant capacity of peptides rich in histidine from the 11S globulin fraction was reported
                    by Silva-Sánchez et al. (2008), while other authors found the same capacity for all protein
                    fractions of amaranth (Orona-Tamayo et al., 2019). Tri- and tetrapeptides showed in vitro
                    hypocholesterolemic capacity by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA
                    reductase), which is responsible for endogenous cholesterol synthesis (Morales et al., 2020, Soares
                    et al., 2015). On the other hand, in vivo studies suggest a hypocholesterolemic effect through the
                    action of fibers, inhibiting the ileal reabsorption of bile acids and favoring the control of
                    cholesterol synthesis and catabolism (Cazarin et al., 2012, Sisti et al., 2019).

                    Chia (Salvia hispanica L.) is an herbaceous plant from the Lamiaceae family, native to Mexico,
                    Guatemala, and California (Koner, Dash, Priya, & Rajeswari, 2019). Its grains contain several
                    bioactive compounds such as quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin, chlorogenic, caffeoylquinic,
                    salvianolic, and protocatechuic acids, in addition to fibers and polyunsaturated fatty acids, mainly
                    linolenic and oleic acids (Marineli et al., 2014, Miller et al., 2017, Oliveira-Alves et al., 2017).

                    Chia showed positive effects against induced obesity in animal models (Carnier et al., 2017), and
                    some of the outcomes were improvement of acute dyslipidemia and steatohepatitis in rats
                    (Fernández‐Martínez et al., 2019), reduction adipose tissue inflammation (Martino et al., 2020), and
                    improvement of white adipose tissue browning in high-fat diet-induced-obese mice (de Souza et al.,
                    2020).

                    Recent clinical studies have shown that the administration of chia seed could reduce the risk
                    factors to develop non-communicable diseases (Lombardo, Creus, Oliva, & Chicco, 2019). Chia intake
                    can manage obesity and diabetes, promoting weight loss and reducing risk factors such as glycemia
                    (Vuksan et al., 2017).

                    This ancient grain has also been used beyond health purposes and has several technological
                    applications in food products as films (Urbizo-Reyes, San Martin-González, Garcia-Bravo, & Liceaga,
                    2020), meat products (Barros et al., 2018, Fernández-López et al., 2019), dairy products (Cardoso et
                    al., 2020), gluten free formulations (Menga et al., 2017), and even as nanoparticles for
                    antibacterial applications (Hernández-Morales et al., 2019).

                    Sorghum is considered suitable for sustainable production systems and can be a source of bioactive
                    compounds associated with the prevention of chronic diseases (Girard & Awika, 2018). It contains
                    resistant starch, soluble and insoluble dietary fiber (with beta-glucans), phenolic compounds such
                    as luteolinidine, apigeninidine, 5-methoxylutelinidine, 7-methoxyapigeninidine, luteoline, apigenin,
                    naringenin, and eriodictyol, which are responsible for metabolism modulation and health improvement
                    (Przybylska-Balcerek et al., 2019, Teixeira Nde et al., 2016, Wu et al., 2016).

                    Humans have been using sorghum for a long time as food, but the consumption is lower than that of
                    other grains, such as wheat. Nevertheless, its use as human food is rising, mainly due to the
                    replacement of gluten-free wheat (McGinnis & Painter, 2020). Additionally, it can be used in food
                    products including fermented products (Adebo, 2020), cooked products (Weerasooriya, Bean, Nugusu,
                    Ioerger, & Tesso, 2018), food complements (Okoth, Ochola, Gikonyo, & Makokha, 2017), and pasta
                    (Palavecino, Ribotta, León, & Bustos, 2019).

                    In general, there are reports about many health-promoting benefits of sorghum ingestion, such as
                    antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacities, cancer, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease
                    prevention, including actions against diabetes and obesity (de Sousa et al., 2018, Smolensky et al.,
                    2018, Xiong et al., 2019). Concerning obesity and insulin resistance, the known health benefits
                    reported for this grain include improving antioxidant response and reducing glucose digestion
                    (Moraes et al., 2015). Furthermore, sorghum has effectively reduced liver fat, plasma lipid
                    peroxidation and fasting glucose, improved glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, and islet insulin
                    secretion in an obesity animal model induced by a high-fat diet (Moraes et al., 2018).
